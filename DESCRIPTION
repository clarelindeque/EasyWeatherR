Title: Manipulate and Visualise Data from an EasyWeather Weather Station
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Clare Lindeque
Maintainer: Clare Lindeque <clarelindeque@gmail.com>
Description: The EasyWeatherR package loads, manipulates and plots data
        retrieved from AmbientWeather weather stations running the HP2000
        software. This data is available from the weather station console in
        csv format, with a date column and 20 standard columns of data. Weather
        stations that do not contain a particular sensor will not report all 
        data types but will contain "--" or some other indicator of missing
        data in those columns. The standard columns are, in addition to a 
        column number and a Date/Time stamp, as follows:
        Indoor Temperature (°C),	Indoor Humidity (%),	Outdoor Temperature
        (°C),	Outdoor Humidity (%),	Wind (km/h),	Gust (km/h),	Dew Point (°C),	
        Wind Chill (°C),	Wind Direction (°),	ABS Barometer (hpa),	REL 
        Barometer (hpa)	Rain Rate (mm/h)	Daily Rain (mm)	Weekly Rain (mm),	
        Monthly Rain (mm),	Yearly Rain (mm),	Solar Rad. (w/<U+33A1>),	Heat index (°C),
        UV (uW/c<U+33A1>),	and UVI.
        These column names are tidied up using the janitor package.
